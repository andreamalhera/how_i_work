# To reduce technical debt 
* Abstraction
* Discover repositories
* Beware of technology boundaries: Leave API logic close to the API and business logic separately
* Ged rid of redundancy
* Lines of code: Less is more 
* Good naming is key: 
  * How to decide on good naming? As specific as possible
  * Avoid too general names (process... data... ) 
     * Effect: Magnetic effect, classes grow decreasing readability
     * Instead ask yourself: "What data?, What process?"
     * Christmas Tree Effect

* Comments
  * Get rid of zombie code 
  * Use constants instead of numbers. --> Keep comments to a min 
  * Testing
    * Use many unit tests for larger class and 1 integration test
