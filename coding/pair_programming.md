# Pair programming

Kent Beck: Continuous Integration; Collective Ownership and Pair Programming.

* Focus on shared responsibility.
* Roles:
   * Navigator:
         Goal; What and why; strategy
         * Challenges:
              * When to interupt driver. Solution: take notes
              * When to swap roles to balance cognitive charge
              * Recognise blockages
    * Driver:
          Scope on concrete code step; What and how
         * Challenges:
              * Communication (no more than 2-3 silence minutes) Solution: comment what you do
              * Don't monopolise keyboard: Let navigator use keyboard to explain points
              * Overcome fear of being exposed with mistakes or even blockages.

* General challenges:
     * Proper environment: zoom?

* Can learn from each other:
     * Strategy
     * Tools
     * Work focus

* Questions:
  * As navigator: How to ask the right questions when we have lost the thread and don't want the pair programming session to turn into a training session?
  Solution: "What value does this add for us?"
  * Unevenness breaks?
  Define times for working and breaks to check slack, e-mails and blockages.
  * Task that are very little suitable for pair programming:
          * documentation
