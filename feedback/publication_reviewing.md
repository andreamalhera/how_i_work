# How to give a review
## Content notes
Most conferences offer a template containing requirements. Generally it goes as follows:

* Summarize content
* List some positive remarks
* List some negative remarks
* List minor issues
* Write overall score and verdict

## Manner and wording
Based on code of review from [CIKM2020](https://www.cikm2020.org/)
Please make sure that reviews are worded politely. Authors may get upset at reviews perceived impolite. Make sure that reviews:
	1. criticize the paper and not the authors,
	2. avoid using loaded words (such as "naive", "useless", or "nonsense" :)).
	3. are written as a technical text (I feel... and I believe... lead to personal battles :)),
	4. are supported with references (as opposed to hint to personal experience) and
	5. are as detailed and constructive as possible (avoid saying what the paper does *not* do, and say instead what the paper *should* do!).
2. Keep in mind that: Some authors are graduate students, perhaps submitting their very first papers. They will feel extremely discouraged by harsh reviews.
Let's go easy on our graduate students :) We can maintain high quality selection while rejecting a submission politely with detailed information on how to improve the work.
3. Finally, these reviews are the "training data" for next-generation reviewers. If we want high-quality reviews in the future, we need to train our future reviewers by providing high-quality reviews now. Otherwise, the current graduate students will think this is the way papers should be reviewed, and the bad-review cycle will continue.
